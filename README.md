**NOTE:**
For this project, the 2008-2009 ANES Panel Data is used, which can be obtained [here.](https://electionstudies.org/)

**NOTE 5/8/2020:**
From the initial data cleaning of the ANES, 2656 people received question, but only 2125 people answered closeness to any of their network size, suggesting that the 531 that did not answer any of the network size relation questions, implying potential zeroes. Under this, there would only be 531 potential zeroes compared to 1584 NAs given by those that were not asked the question.
